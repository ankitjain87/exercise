- Design a product review system very similar to what you see for products on Amazon.
- Design a data store. Use any of the databases you are comfortable with. Explain the reasoning behind the design choices.
- Create a REST API for adding, updating, deleting, viewing the reviews.
- API should support viewing reviews customer wise and product wise.
Assume that the code will run on a server. Assume that this work is a part of a web app that
needs to be built further by multiple development teams and will be maintained and evolved for several years in the future. 

In addition to these, make any assumptions necessary, but discuss those assumptions explicitly. 

Use any programming language and library of your choice, but we suggest you use the language you are most comfortable with.

Write unit tests for your code.
